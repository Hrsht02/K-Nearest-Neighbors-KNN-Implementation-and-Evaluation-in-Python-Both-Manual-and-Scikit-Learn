# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Implementation-and-Evaluation-in-Python-Both-Manual-and-Scikit-Learn
A Python-based implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification, featuring a custom KNN model built from scratch and a comparison with Scikit-Learn's KNN. Applied to the Iris dataset, this project demonstrates the mechanics and effectiveness of KNN in classification tasks.
