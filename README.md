# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm: Manual Implementation and Scikit-Learn Comparison

This repository contains a hands-on implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using Python. This project includes both a custom-built KNN model, implemented from scratch, and a benchmark comparison with Scikit-Learn's KNN model. By applying these models to the Iris dataset, we explore KNN’s mechanics and demonstrate its effectiveness in a straightforward classification task.

## Overview
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a supervised learning method frequently used in classification problems. This project dives into how KNN works by calculating distances between data points to find the "k" closest points and making predictions based on their labels. This repository provides a clear, step-by-step implementation of this process and compares it to Scikit-Learn’s KNN model to confirm accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Custom KNN Implementation**:
  - **Euclidean Distance Calculation**: Calculates distances between test and training points to identify similarity.
  - **Nearest Neighbor Selection**: Selects the k-closest points based on calculated distances.
  - **Voting Mechanism**: Uses majority voting among nearest neighbors to classify test points.

- **Scikit-Learn KNN Model**:
  - Utilizes Scikit-Learn’s `KNeighborsClassifier` for a quick, validated comparison.
  - Achieves identical performance to validate the accuracy of the custom KNN implementation.

- **Data Normalization**:
  - Applies L2 normalization on features to standardize input data, ensuring all features contribute proportionately to distance calculations.

## Project Structure
- **`knn_implementation.py`**: The main Python script containing:
  - Functions for manual KNN implementation.
  - Code for Scikit-Learn’s KNN and accuracy comparison.
- **`data/datairis.csv`**: Iris dataset file used for model training and testing.
- **`README.md`**: Detailed overview, usage instructions, and project explanation.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KNN-Implementation.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the project by executing the main Python script:
```bash
python knn_implementation.py
```
This script will train both the manual and Scikit-Learn KNN models, classify test data points, and output accuracy results for both implementations.

## Model Workflow

1. **Data Normalization**: 
   - Normalize features using L2 normalization to standardize input values.
   
2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Calculate Euclidean distance between each test point and all training points.

3. **Finding Nearest Neighbors**:
   - Sort distances, selecting the k-nearest neighbors for each test point.

4. **Majority Voting**:
   - Determine the predicted class for each test point based on the most common class among the k-nearest neighbors.

5. **Accuracy Evaluation**:
   - Calculate and compare accuracy scores for the manual and Scikit-Learn KNN implementations.

## Results
On the Iris dataset, both the manual and Scikit-Learn KNN models achieved an accuracy of 97%. This consistency demonstrates that the custom implementation closely matches the standardized Scikit-Learn model, validating its accuracy.
